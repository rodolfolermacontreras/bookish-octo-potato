Artificial Neural Networks

# Problem:
For this assignment you will start from the perceptron neural network notebook (Simple Perceptron Neural Network.ipynb) and modify the python code to make it into a multi-layer neural network classifier. To test your system, use the RedWhiteWine.csv file with the goal of building a red or white wine classifier. Use all the features in the dataset, allowing the network to decide how to build the internal weighting system. To review the data attributes, download the L08_WineQuality.pdf.


# Abstract:
Mackenzie has a wine bottling factory and recently attended a followup symposium on deep learning and has returned with fascinating ideas to build neural networks to perform classification tasks. She had the idea of building a red-white wine classifier so that the bottle labels can be automatically generated. She approached your team, and suggested that you build a red-white wine classifier as a modified simple perceptron.

The analysis is is divided the following way:

### Data Exploration
- **Visual Exploration**
- **Formatting the variables**
    - One hot encoding
    - Normalizing features from 0-1


### Analysis
- **Logistic (Sigmoid) Function**
- **Initialize Parameters**
- **Forward Propagation**
- **Backpropagation**
- **Gradient Descent**
- **Running experiment**
    - Hyperparamters
- **Results**

        
### Summary of Models Performance
